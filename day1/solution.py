"""Day 1 of Advent of Code 2024.
The goal of part 1 is to find the sum of the absolute differences between the
two lists of integers after the lists have been sorted from least to greatest.

The goal of part 2 is to find the sum of each integer in the first list
multiplied by the count of its appearance in the second list. By using
dictionaries as counters, we can quickly multiply each unique integer in the
left list by it's occurance in the left list and the right list to not make
repeated calls to the right lists dictionary count.
